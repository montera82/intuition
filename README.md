# Introduction

Implement a method that on a given Binary Search Tree finds

the largest value that is smaller than the value passed as a parameter to the method, without using

existing tree implementations found in a library.


# Methodology Used

This project implements a Binary Search Tree from scratch. The method of interest here is the findSmallestClosetNode method located in the BinaryTreeImp class, which uses InOrder trasversal to search through the BST for the smallest number clossest to the number to find ( long toFind in this case. ).

# Time Complexity of the Algorithm

The minimum time complexity of the algorithm is O(n) ( i.e linear with respect to the number of nodes in the tree. )


# Instructions

You will need Visual studio 2015 and upwards to run this project.
This project using the .net framework 4.5.2
The accopanied Unit tests can be run be navigating to Test -> Run all
